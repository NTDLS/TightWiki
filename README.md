# TightWiki

For years I’ve worked at places where we just needed a simple to use, searchable, unobtrusive, no-nonsense, collaborative and free place to dump documentation.
The first thing that comes to mind is a Wiki but for some reason I can never find anything that "checks all the boxes". Hopefully you'll find this one does for you.

:yum: TightWiki is an ASP.NET Core MVC Razor WIKI written in C# that sits on top of a SQLite database (zero configuration required).

:crossed_fingers: Play with the latest dev build at http://TightWiki.com/. If you want to edit, you can signup using google auth or native TightWiki login.

:eyes: Or check out the full wiki [documentation](https://tightwiki.com/Wiki%20Help%20::%20Wiki%20Help) to learn about the engine functionality.

:boom: Also be sure to check out the screenshots below the feature list...

:anguished: Its been like a modern retelling of Sisyphus, only this time the stone is RegEx.
