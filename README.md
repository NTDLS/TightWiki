# TightWiki

For years Iâ€™ve worked at places where we just needed a simple to use, searchable, unobtrusive, no-nonsense, collaborative and free place to dump documentation.
The first thing that comes to mind is a Wiki but for some reason I can never find anything that "checks all the boxes". Hopefully you'll find this one does for you.

:yum: TightWiki is an ASP.NET Core MVC Razor WIKI written in C# that sits on top of a SQLite database (zero configuration required).

:crossed_fingers: Play with the latest dev build at http://TightWiki.com/. If you want to edit, you can signup using google auth or native TightWiki login.

:eyes: Or check out the full wiki [documentation](https://tightwiki.com/Wiki%20Help%20::%20Wiki%20Help) to learn about the engine functionality.

:star: Ready to run it for yourself? Check out the [installation instructions](https://tightwiki.com/wiki_help::installation)!

:boom: Also be sure to check out the screenshots below the feature list...

:anguished: Its been like a modern retelling of Sisyphus, only this time the stone is RegEx.

# Site Metrics
We've beat the wiki up with more data than this, but this is our standard workload. ~45,000 pages, in ~400 namespaces, with ~250,000 revisions, created by ~1,000 users, manifesting ~5 million search tokens. The random fuzzy-match search time is 11 milliseconds. Not too shabby, right?
